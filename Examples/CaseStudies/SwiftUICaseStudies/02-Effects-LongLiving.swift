  This application demonstrates how to handle long-living effects, for example notifications from \
  Notification Center, and how to tie an effect's lifetime to the lifetime of the view.

  Run this application in the simulator, and take a few screenshots by going to \
  *Device â€º Screenshot* in the menu, and observe that the UI counts the number of times that \
  happens.

  Then, navigate to another screen and take screenshots there, and observe that this screen does \
  *not* count those screenshots. The notifications effect is automatically cancelled when leaving \
  the screen, and restarted when entering the screen.
